#Tidier Drawings of Trees
The objective of this project was to implement:
<b>E. M. Reingold and J. S. Tilford. 1981. Tidier Drawings of Trees. IEEE Trans. Softw. Eng. 7, 2 (March 1981), 223â€“228. </b>

The algorithm talks about an optimal tree drawing algorithm that takes into account four important aesthetics including symmetry of subtrees. The algoritm produces pleasing tree outputs. On a screen of $1920 \times 1080$, a depth of tree $20$ was achieved for a randomly spaced tree. However, only a depth of $7$ was achieved for complete binary trees.

OpenGL (with C++) was used to render the trees after the output was obtained from the algorithm described above.

## Analysis of code
The execution time here is the time taken to:
   1. Generate the complete tree using generator
   2. Run the algorithm described in paper
   3. Get lines and circles for edges and nodes

Depth of tree | Number of nodes | Execution time
--- | --- | ---
2 |7|0.008s
3 |15|0.004s
7 |255|0.074s
8 |511|0.137s
9 |1023|0.258s
10 |2047|0.461s
11 |4095|0.915s
12 |8191|1.768s
13 |16383 |3.446s

For random trees

Depth of tree | Number of nodes | Execution time
--- | --- | ---
